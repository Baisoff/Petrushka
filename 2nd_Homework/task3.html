    <div class="central"><b>Cheburashka</b> is an iconic Russian classic cartoon character who later became a popular character in
        Russian
        jokes (along with his friend, <em>Gena the Crocodile</em>). According to the creator of the character,
        Eduard Uspensky
        (1965), Cheburashka is an "animal unknown to science", with large monkey-like ears and a body resembling
        that
        of a cub, who lives in a tropical forest. He accidentally gets into a crate of oranges, eats his fill, and
        falls asleep. The crate is eventually delivered to a grocery store in an unnamed Russian city (hinted to be
        Moscow), where the rest of the main story unfolds.
