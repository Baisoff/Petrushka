                Eduard Uspensky
                (1965), Cheburashka is an "animal unknown to science", with large monkey-like ears and a body resembling

                of a cub, who lives in a tropical forest. He accidentally gets into a crate of oranges, eats his fill, and
                falls asleep. The crate is eventually delivered to a grocery store in an unnamed Russian city (hinted to be
                Moscow), where the rest of the main story unfolds.</p>
