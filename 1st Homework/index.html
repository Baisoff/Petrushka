        <p> <b>Cheburashka</b> is an iconic Russian classic cartoon character who later became a popular character in
            Russian
            jokes (along with his friend, <em>Gena the Crocodile</em>). According to the creator of the character,
            Eduard Uspensky
            (1965), Cheburashka is an "animal unknown to science", with large monkey-like ears and a body resembling
            that
            of a cub, who lives in a tropical forest. He accidentally gets into a crate of oranges, eats his fill, and
            falls asleep. The crate is eventually delivered to a grocery store in an unnamed Russian city (hinted to be
            Moscow), where the rest of the main story unfolds.
